Q1. What does the Ðc flag do in gcc?
	Compiles the source file but does not link them
Q2. What does the Ðo flag do in gcc?
	It saves the file. Writes the executable file.

Compile the program using Ðg flag so we can use the debugger, gdb. 

Q3. How do you load output0 into gdb? (give the command)
	gcc -g output0.o -o output0
Q4. How do you set breakpoint at main? (give the command)
	break output0.c:main
Q5. Command to run output0 inside gdb
	run
Q6. Command to single-step through the program
	step or s or next
Q7. First output gives the value of the most significant bit (MSB) of an unsigned int. 
What is the size (# of bits) of an unsigned int?
  32
Q8. Second output gives the value of a long int. 
What is the size of a long? 
  64
Q9. Third output shows the most negative signed int. 
Is the size of a signed int
the same as an unsigned int?
  32
Q10. Fourth line shows the value of the most negative value?s negation, ie Ð most_negative_number. What is the output and the reason for the value to be this way? 
(Hint: remember the property of 2?s complement representation)
	overflows from most negative to most positive
